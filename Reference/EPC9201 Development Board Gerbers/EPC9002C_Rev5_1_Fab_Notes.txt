Printed Circuit board fabrication instructions, unless otherwise specified:

1.  Material, Copper Clad Laminate sheet in accordance with IPC-4101.
    Total Board thickness to be 0.062 inches with torelarance to be +/-10%
    Material: Use FR370-HR Substrate or similar. Must have the following Properties:
	a. Tg(min) = 180 degrees C
	b. Td(min) = 340 degrees C
	c. Flame rating 94V0
	d. Dielectric = 4.0/5.0

2.  All holes to be located by pad centers & be within .003 inches dia. of true position.
    Layer to layer registration to be within 0.002 inches

3.  All vias (less than and equal to .015 inches holes) to be tented on both sides of the board
    All vias (less than and equal to .015 inches holes) are to be filled (non conductive)

4.  All holes to be Copper (Cu) Plated thru per IPC-2221, 0.000787 inches min. thickness

5.  Solder Mask over bare Copper, both sides, using Taiyu 4000HFX L.P.I or
    equiv., color green per IPC-SM-840, class T, RoHS Compliant
    Solder mask created 1:1, do not enlarge or modify.
    LDI mask must be used to register tolerance.
    Solder Mask to copper layer registration to be within 0.002 inches
    Do not clip solder mask
    *Replacement of 'PSR-2000/LF02/CA-25' is approved

6.  Finish, all exposed Copper, both sides, after solder mask, to be
    Electroless Nickle Immersion Gold (Ni thickness typical 150 microinches
    and Au 3-5 micro inches) in accordance with IPC-4552

7.  Silkscreen both sides using white permanent ink.
    Silkscreen to copper layer registration to be within 0.002 inches

8.  Create an array panel as follows:
        Array is 3 Boards in X-direction(horizontal) by 2 Boards in Y-direction (vertical)
	6 boards per array.
	Array boundary is to be 10 mm width on all sides
        Use 4off fiducial marks on array of 0.040 inches diameter solid circle placed on array frame
	Fiducial must be global defined and orthogonally located with respect to each other
        Fifucials must have .150 inches diameter clearance
	Include 4 tooling holes, .125 inches +.003 inches -0.0 diameter, non-plated
	Tooling holes to be located in each of the corners of the breakaway section in center of frame
	V-score complete array

9.  Fabricate using Gerber artwork. Do not add any text, logos, etc. to the top side of the board.

10. Acceptability of PCB Fabrication, except as specified in this drawing,
    must comply to IPC-6012B, class 2.
	Compelete array flatness must be within 7.5 mil per inch

11. Any changes to the design must be approved by EPC in writing.

12. Array Gerber files to be provided to EPC for approval

13. Stackup:
	Total thickness target - 62 mils
	Core thickness tolerance is +/- 10%
	Copper thickness can be plated up
	Stackup
		Top Layer	- 1.0 oz minimum -2.0 oz target. Specify copper thickness and final thickness after ENIG plating
			Prepreg		- 5 mils
		Mid Layer 1	- 2.0 oz
			Core		- ~43 mils
		Mid Layer 2	- 2.0 oz
			Prepreg		- 5 mils
		Bottom Layer	- 1.0 oz minimum -2.0 oz target. Specify copper thickness and final thickness after ENIG plating
